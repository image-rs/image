# Rust Image Release Notes

Rust image aims to be a pure-Rust implementation of various popular image formats. Accompanying reading/write support, rust image provides basic imaging processing function. See `README.md` for further details.

## Known issues
 - Not all Interlaced (progressive) or animated images are well supported.
 - The color space information of pixels is not clearly communicated.
 - Initialization via byte-based buffers and ffi is a work-in-progress.

## Changes

### Unreleased

- More convenient to use buffers will be added in the future. In particular,
  improving initialization, passing of output buffers, and adding a more
  complete representation for layouts. The plan is for these to interact with
  the rest of the library through a byte-based interface similar to
  `ImageDecoder`.
  See ongoing work on [`image-canvas`](https://github.com/image-rs/canvas) if
  you want to participate.

### Version 0.24.6

- Add support for QOI.
- ImageDecoders now expose ICC profiles on supported formats.
- Add support for BMPs without a file header.
- Improved AVIF encoder.
- WebP decoding fixes.

### Version 0.24.5

Structural changes:
- Increased the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.61.
- Increased the version requirement for the `tiff` crate to 0.8.0.
- Increased the version requirement for the `jpeg` crate to 0.3.0.

Bug fixes:
- The `as_rgb32f` function of `DynamicImage` is now correctly documented.
- Fixed a crash when decoding ICO images. Added a regression test.
- Fixed a panic when transforming webp images. Added a regression test.
- Added a check to prevent integer overflow when calculating file size for BMP
  images. The missing check could panic in debug mode or else set an incorrect
  file size in release mode.
- Upgraded the PNG image encoder to use the newer `PngEncoder::write_image`
  instead of the deprecated `PngEncoder::encode` which did not account for byte
  order and could result in images with incorrect colors.
- Fixed `InsufficientMemory` error when trying to decode a PNG image.
- Fix warnings and CI issues.
- Typos and links in the documentation have been corrected.

Performance:
- Added check for dynamic image dimensions before resizing. This improves
  performance in cases where the image does not need to be resized or has
  already been resized.

### Version 0.24.4

New Features:
- Encoding for `webp` is now available with the native library. This needs to
  be activate explicitly with the `web-encoder` feature.
- `exr` decoding has gained basic limit support.

Bug fixes:
- The `Iterator::size_hint` implementation of pixel iterators has been fixed to
  return the current length indicated by its `ExactSizeIterator` hint.
- Typos and bad references in the documentation have been removed.

Performance:
- `ImageBuffer::get_pixel{,_mut}` is now marked inline.
- `resize` now short-circuits when image dimensions are unchanged.

### Version 0.24.3

New Features:
- `TiffDecoder` now supports setting resource limits.

Bug fixes:
- Fix compile issues on little endian systems.
- Various panics discovered by fuzzing.

### Version 0.24.2

Structural changes:
- CI now runs `cargo-deny`, checking dependent crates to an OSS license list
  and against RUSTSEC advisories.

New Features:
- The WebP decoder recognizes and decodes images with `VP8X` header.
- The DDS decoder recognizes and decodes images with `DX10` headers.

Bug fixes:
- Calling `DynamicImage`/`ImageBuffer`'s methods `write_to` and `save` will now
  work properly even if the backing container is larger than the image layout
  requires. Only the relevant slice of pixel data is passed to the encoder.
- Fixed a OOM-panic caused by malformed images in the `gif` decoder.

### Version 0.24.1

Bug Fixes:
- ImageBuffer::get_pixel_checked would sometimes return the incorrect pixel.
- PNG encoding would sometimes not recognize unsupported color.

### Version 0.24.0

Breaking changes

Structural changes:
- Minimum Rust version is now `1.56` and may change in minor versions until
  further notice. It is now tracked in the library's `Cargo.toml`, instead, by
  the standard `[package.rust-version]` field. Note: this applies _to the
  library itself_. You may need different version resolutions for dependencies
  when using a non-stable version of Rust.
- The `math::utils::{nq, utils}` modules have been removed. These are better
  served through the `color_quant` crate and the standard library respectively.
- All codecs are now available through `image::codecs`, no longer top-level.
- `ExtendedColorType` and `DynamicImage` have been made `#[non_exhaustive]`,
  providing more methods instead of exhaustive matching.
- Reading images through the generic `io::Reader`, as well as generic
  convenience interfaces, now requires the underlying reader to be `BufRead +
  Seek`. This allows more efficient support more formats. Similarly, writing
  now requires writers to be `Write + Seek`.
- The `Bgra*` variants of buffers, which were only half-supported, have been
  removed. The owning buffer types `ImageBuffer` and `DynamicImage`
  fundamentally already make a choice in supported pixel representations. This
  allows for more consistent internal behavior. Callers are expected to convert
  formats when using those buffers, which they are required to do in any case
  already, and which is routinely performed by decoders.

Trait reworks:
- The `Pixel` trait is no longer implemented quite as liberally for structs
  defined in the crate. Instead, it is now restricted to a set of known channel
  which ensures accuracy in computations involving those channels.
- The `ImageDecoderExt` trait has been renamed to `ImageDecoderRect`, according
  to its actual functionality.
- The `Pixel` trait and its `Subpixel` field no longer require (or provide) a
  `'static` lifetime bound.
- The `Pixel` trait no longer requires specifying an associated, constant
  `ColorType`. This was of little relevance to computation but made it much
  harder to implement and extend correctly. Instead, the _private_
  `PixelWithColorType` extension is added for interfaces that require a
  properly known variant.
- Reworked how `SubImage` interacts with the `GenericImage` trait. It is now a
  default implementation. Note that `SubImage` now has _inherent_ methods that
  avoid double-indirection, the trait's method will no longer avoid this.
- The `Primitive` trait now requires implementations to provide a minimum and
  maximum logical bound for the purpose of converting to other primitive
  representations.

Additions

Image formats:
- Reading lossless WebP is now supported.
- The OpenEXR format is now supported.
- The `jpeg` decoder has been upgraded to Lossless JPEG.
- The `AvifEncoder` now correctly handles alpha-less images. Some additional
  color formats are converted to RGBA as well.
- The `Bmp` codec now decodes more valid images. It can decode a raw image
  without performing the palette mapping. It provides a method to access the
  palette. The encoder provides the inverse capabilities.
- `Tiff` is now an output format.

Buffers and Operations:
- The channel / primitive type `f32` is now supported. Currently only the
  OpenEXR codec makes full use of it but this is expected to change.
- `ImageBuffer::{get_pixel_checked, get_pixel_mut_checked}` provide panic-free
  access to pixels and channels by returning `Option<&P>` and `Option<&mut P>`.
- `ImageBuffer::write_to` has been added, encoding the buffer to a writer. This
  method already existed on `DynamicImage`.
- `DynamicImage` now implements `From<_>` for all supported buffer types.
- `DynamicImage` now implements `Default`, an empty `Rgba8` image.
- `imageops::overlay` now takes coordinates as `i64`.

Limits:
- Added `Limits` and `LimitSupport`, utilized in `io::Reader`. These can be
  configured for rudimentary protection against resource exhaustion (images
  pretending to require a very large buffer). These types are not yet
  exhaustive by design, and more and stricter limits may be added in the
  future.
- Encoders that do provide inherent support for limits, or reserve a
  significant amount of internal memory, are urged to implement the
  `set_limits` extension to `ImageDecoder`. Some strict limit are opt-in, which
  may cause decoding to fail if not supported.

Miscellaneous:
- `PNMSubtype` has been renamed to `PnmSubtype`, by Rust's naming scheme.
- Several incorrectly capitalized `PNM*` aliases have been removed.
- Several `enum` types that had previously used a hidden variant now use the
  official `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute instead.

### Version 0.23.14

- Unified gif blending in different decode methods, fixing out-of-bounds checks
  in a number of weirdly positioned frames.
- Hardened TGA decoder against a number of malicious inputs.
- Fix forward incompatible usage of the panic macro.
- Fix load_rect for gif reaching `unreachable!()` code.

- Added `ExtendedColorType::A8`.
- Allow TGA to load alpha-only images.
- Optimized load_rect to avoid unnecessary seeks.

### Version 0.23.13

- Fix an inconsistency in supported formats of different methods for encoding
  an image.
- Fix `thumbnail` choosing an empty image. It now always prefer non-empty image
  dimensions.
- Fix integer overflow in calculating requires bytes for decoded image buffers
  for farbfeld, hdr, and pnm decoders. These will now error early.
- Fix a panic decoding certain `jpeg` image without frames or meta data.
- Optimized the `jpeg` encoder.
- Optimized `GenericImage::copy_from` default impl in various cases.

- Add `avif` decoders. You must enable it explicitly and it is not covered by
  our usual MSRV policy of Rust 1.34. Instead, only latest stable is supported.
- Add `ImageFormat::{can_read, can_write}`
- Add `Frame::buffer_mut`
- Add speed and quality options on `avif` encoder.
- Add speed parameter to `gif` encoder.
- Expose control over sequence repeat to the `gif` encoder.
- Add `{contrast,brighten,huerotate}_in_place` functions in imageproc.

- Relax `Default` impl of `ImageBuffer`, removing the bound on the color type.
- Derive Debug, Hash, PartialEq, Eq for DynamicImage

### Version 0.23.12

- Fix a soundness issue affecting the impls of `Pixel::from_slice_mut`. This
  would previously reborrow the mutable input reference as a shared one but
  then proceed to construct the mutable result reference from it. While UB
  according to Rust's memory model, we're fairly certain that no miscompilation
  can happen with the LLVM codegen in practice.
  See 5cbe1e6767d11aff3f14c7ad69a06b04e8d583c7 for more details.
- Fix `imageops::blur` panicking when `sigma = 0.0`. It now defaults to `1.0`
  as all negative values.
- Fix re-exporting `png::{CompressionType, FilterType}` to maintain SemVer
  compatibility with the `0.23` releases.

- Add `ImageFormat::from_extension`
- Add copyless DynamicImage to byte slice/vec conversion.
- Add bit-depth specific `into_` and `to_` DynamicImage conversion methods.


### Version 0.23.11

- The `NeuQuant` implementation is now supplied by `color_quant`. Use of the
  type defined by this library is discouraged.
- The `jpeg` decoder can now downscale images that are decoded by 1,2,4,8.
- Optimized the jpeg encoding ~5-15%.
- Deprecated the `clamp` function. Use `num-traits` instead.
- The ICO decoder now accepts an empty mask.
- Fixed an overflow in ICO mask decoding potentially leading to panic.
- Added `ImageOutputFormat` for `AVIF`
- Updated `tiff` to `0.6` with lzw performance improvements.

### Version 0.23.10

- Added AVIF encoding capabilities using the `ravif` crate. Please note that
  the feature targets the latest stable compiler and is not enabled by default.
- Added `ImageBuffer::as_raw` to inspect the underlying container.
- Updated `gif` to `0.11` with large performance improvements.

### Version 0.23.9

- Introduced correctly capitalized aliases for some scream case types
- Introduced `imageops::{vertical_gradient, horizontal_gradient}` for writing
  simple color gradients into an image.
- Sped up methods iterating over `Pixels`, `PixelsMut`, etc. by using exact
  chunks internally. This should auto-vectorize `ImageBuffer::from_pixel`.
- Adjusted `Clone` impls of iterators to not require a bound on the pixel.
- Add `Debug` impls for iterators where the pixel's channel implements it.
- Add comparison impls for `FilterType`

### Version 0.23.8

- `flat::Error` now implements the standard `Error` trait
- The type parameter of `Map` has been relaxed to `?Sized`
- Added the `imageops::tile` function that repeats one image across another

### Version 0.23.7

- Iterators over immutable pixels of `ImageBuffer` can now be cloned
- Added a `tga` encoder
- Added `ColorMap::lookup`, an optional reversal of the map
- The `EncodableLayout` trait is now exported

### Version 0.23.6

- Added `png::ApngDecoder`, an adapter decoding the animation in an APNG.
- Fixed a bug in `jpeg` encoding that would darken output colors.
- Added a utility constructor `FlatSamples::with_monocolor`.
- Added `ImageBuffer::as_flat_samples_mut` which is a mutable variant of the
  existing ffi-helper `ImageBuffer::as_flat_samples`.

### Version 0.23.5

- The `png` encoder now allows configuring compression and filter type. The
  output is not part of stability guarantees, see its documentation.
- The `jpeg` encoder now accepts any implementor of `GenericImageView`. This
  allows images that are only partially present in memory to be encoded.
- `ImageBuffer` now derives `Hash`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`.
- The `Pixels`/`PixelsMut` iterator no longer yields out-of-bounds pixels when
  the underlying buffer is larger than required.
- The `pbm` decoder correctly decodes ascii data again, fixing a regression
  where it would use the sample value `1` as white instead of `255`.
- Fix encoding of RGBA data in `gif` frames.
- Constructing a `Rows`/`RowsMut` iterator no longer panics when the image has
  a width or height of `0`.

### Version 0.23.4

- Improved the performance of decoding animated gifs
- Added `crop_imm` which functions like `crop` but on a shared reference
- The gif `DisposalMethod::Any` is treated as `Keep`, consistent with browsers
- Most errors no longer allocate a string, instead implement Display.
- Add some implementations of `Error::source`

### Version 0.23.3

- Added `ColorType::has_alpha` to facilitate lossless conversion
- Recognize extended WebP formats for decoding
- Added decoding and encoding for the `farbfeld` format

### Version 0.23.1

- Fix cmyk_to_rgb (jpeg) causing off by one rounding errors.
- A number of performance improvements for jpeg (encode and decode), bmp, vp8
- Added more details to errors for many formats

### Version 0.23.0

This major release intends to improve the interface with regards to handling of
color format data and errors for both decoding and encoding. This necessitated
many breaking changes anyways so it was used to improve the compliance to the
interface guidelines such as outstanding renaming.

It is not yet perfect with regards to color spaces but it was designed mainly
as an improvement over the current interface with regards to in-memory color
formats, first. We'll get to color spaces in a later major version.

- Heavily reworked `ColorType`:
  - This type is now used for denoting formats for which we support operations
      on buffers in these memory representations. Particularly, all channels in
      pixel types are assumed to be an integer number of bytes (In terms of the
      Rust type system, these are `Sized` and one can crate slices of channel
      values).
  - An `ExtendedColorType` is used to express more generic color formats for
      which the library has limited support but can be converted/scaled/mapped
      into a `ColorType` buffer. This operation might be fallible but, for
      example, includes sources with 1/2/4-bit components.
  - Both types are non-exhaustive to add more formats in a minor release.
  - A work-in-progress (#1085) will further separate the color model from the
      specific channel instantiation, e.g. both `8-bit RGB` and `16-bit BGR`
      are instantiations of `RGB` color model.
- Heavily rework `ImageError`:
  - The top-level enum type now serves to differentiate cause with multiple
      opaque representations for the actual error. These are no longer simple
      Strings but contains useful types. Third-party decoders that have no
      variant in `ImageFormat` have also been considered.
  - Support for `Error::source` that can be downcast to an error from a
      matching version of the underlying decoders. Note that the version is not
      part of the stable interface guarantees, this should not be relied upon
      for correctness and only be used as an optimization.
  - Added image format indications to errors.
  - The error values produced by decoder will be upgraded incrementally. See
      something that still produces plain old String messages? Feel free to
      send a PR.
- Reworked the `ImageDecoder` trait:
  - `read_image` takes an output buffer argument instead of allocating all
      memory on its own.
  - The return type of `dimensions` now aligns with `GenericImage` sizes.
  - The `colortype` method was renamed to `color_type` for conformity.
- The enums `ColorType`, `DynamicImage`, `imageops::FilterType`, `ImageFormat`
  no longer re-export all of their variants in the top-level of the crate. This
  removes the growing pollution in the documentation and usage. You can still
  insert the equivalent statement on your own:
  `use image::ImageFormat::{self, *};`
- The result of `encode` operations is now uniformly an `ImageResult<()>`.
- Removed public converters from some `tiff`, `png`, `gif`, `jpeg` types,
  mainly such as error conversion. This allows upgrading the dependency across
  major versions without a major release in `image` itself.
- On that note, the public interface of `gif` encoder no longer takes a
  `gif::Frame` but rather deals with `image::Frame` only. If you require to
  specify the disposal method, transparency, etc. then you may want to wait
  with upgrading but (see next change).
- The `gif` encoder now errors on invalid dimensions or unsupported color
  formats. It would previously silently reinterpret bytes as RGB/RGBA.
- The capitalization of  `ImageFormat` and other enum variants has been
  adjusted to adhere to the API guidelines. These variants are now spelled
  `Gif`, `Png`, etc. The same change has been made to the name of types such as
  `HDRDecoder`.
- The `Progress` type has finally received public accessor method. Strange that
  no one reported them missing.
- Introduced `PixelDensity` and `PixelDensityUnit` to store DPI information in
  formats that support encoding this form of meta data (e.g. in `jpeg`).

### Version 0.22.5

- Added `GenericImage::copy_within`, specialized for `ImageBuffer`
- Fixed decoding of interlaced `gif` files
- Prepare for future compatibility of array `IntoIterator` in example code

### Version 0.22.4

- Added in-place variants for flip and rotate operations.
- The bmp encoder now checks if dimensions are valid for the format. It would
  previously write a subset or panic.
- Removed deprecated implementations of `Error::description`
- Added `DynamicImage::into_*` which convert without an additional allocation.
- The PNG encoder errors on unsupported color types where it had previously
  silently swapped color channels.
- Enabled saving images as `gif` with `save_buffer`.

### Version 0.22.3

- Added a new module `io` containing a configurable `Reader`. It can replace
  the bunch of free functions: `image::{load_*, open, image_dimensions}` while
  enabling new combinations such as `open` but with format deduced from content
  instead of file path.
- Fixed `const_err` lint in the macro expanded implementations of `Pixel`. This
  can only affect your crate if `image` is used as a path dependency.

### Version 0.22.2

- Undeprecate `unsafe` trait accessors. Further evaluation showed that their
  deprecation should be delayed until trait `impl` specialization is available.
- Fixed magic bytes used to detect `tiff` images.
- Added `DynamicImage::from_decoder`.
- Fixed a bug in the `PNGReader` that caused an infinite loop.
- Added `ColorType::{bits_per_pixel, num_components}`.
- Added `ImageFormat::from_path`, same format deduction as the `open` method.
- Fixed a panic in the gif decoder.
- Aligned background color handling of `gif` to web browser implementations.
- Fixed handling of partial frames in animated `gif`.
- Removed unused direct `lzw` dependency, an indirect dependency in `tiff`.

### Version 0.22.1

- The required Rust version is now `1.34.2`.
- Note the website and blog: [image-rs.org][1] and [blog.image-rs.org][2]
