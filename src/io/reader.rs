/// A multi-format image reader.
///
/// Wraps an input reader to facilitate automatic detection of an image's format, appropriate
/// decoding method, and dispatches into the set of supported [`ImageDecoder`] implementations.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Opening a file, deducing the format based on the file path automatically, and trying to decode
/// the image contained can be performed by constructing the reader and immediately consuming it.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use image::ImageError;
/// # use image::io::Reader;
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), ImageError> {
/// let image = Reader::open("path/to/image.png")?
///     .decode()?;
/// # Ok(()) }
/// ```
///
/// It is also possible to make a guess based on the content. This is especially handy if the
/// source is some blob in memory and you have constructed the reader in another way. Here is an
/// example with a `pnm` black-and-white subformat that encodes its pixel matrix with ascii values.
///
#[cfg_attr(feature = "pnm", doc = "```")]
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "pnm"), doc = "```no_run")]
/// # use image::ImageError;
/// # use image::io::Reader;
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), ImageError> {
/// use std::io::Cursor;
/// use image::ImageFormat;
///
/// let raw_data = b"P1 2 2\n\
///     0 1\n\
///     1 0\n";
///
/// let mut reader = Reader::new(Cursor::new(raw_data))
///     .with_guessed_format()
///     .expect("Cursor io never fails");
/// assert_eq!(reader.format(), Some(ImageFormat::Pnm));
///
/// let image = reader.decode()?;
/// # Ok(()) }
/// ```
///
/// As a final fallback or if only a specific format must be used, the reader always allows manual
/// specification of the supposed image format with [`set_format`].
